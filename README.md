<h2>Magento 2 Training Repo</h2>

### Go check out Alan Storm
The overwhelming majority of the code in this repository is taken directly from Alan Storm's excellent Magento 2 tutorial series:
http://alanstorm.com/category/magento-2/

There are some exceptions however; I have been trying to alter the UI Components tutorials to bring tehem up to date with Magento 2.2 UI Component syntax changes.

This repository is just keeping track of my Magento 2 training experience, all code was tested on a Magento 2.2.1.
